1. Follow the [CONTRIBUTING documentation](https://github.com/DB-Poultry/DB-Poultry/tree/development?tab=contributing-ov-file#readme).
2. Implement the solution plan.
	- Ensure the code is *well-documented*[^1].
3. Create the [Pull Request](https://github.com/DB-Poultry/DB-Poultry/pulls) following the [`PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE`](https://github.com/DB-Poultry/DB-Poultry/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

Parallel[^2] with: [[4.2 Unit Testing]]

Next step: [[5 Mid-High Level Testing]]

[^1]: A well-documented implementation follows the [JavaDoc guidelines](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html).
[^2]: While developers implement the solution plan, QA  independently create and execute unit tests derived from the same solution plan. Results of these tests form a feedback loop, ensuring the implementation aligns with the intended solution.
