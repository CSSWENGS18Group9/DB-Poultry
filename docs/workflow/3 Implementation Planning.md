| Who Assigned            | Stage     |
| ----------------------- | --------- |
| #Analyst #Developer #QA | #Planning |

1. The #Developer will indicate their *solution plan*[^1] in each <font color="#00b050">GitHub Issue</font> assigned to them in [[2 Issuing]].
2. #QA and #Analyst will **review** the solution plan.

Next parallel[^2] steps: [[4.1 Development]] parallel with [[4.2 Unit Testing]]

[^1]: Follow the [solution plan document format](https://github.com/DB-Poultry/DB-Poultry/blob/development/docs/contributing/solution_plan.md).
[^2]: While developers implement the solution plan, QA  independently create and execute unit tests derived from the same solution plan. Results of these tests form a feedback loop, ensuring the implementation aligns with the intended solution.
