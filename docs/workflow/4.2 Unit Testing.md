1. Create unit tests for the implementation using the solution plan document[^1].
2. Once the implementation is done:
	1. Perform the created unit tests.
	2. **<font color="#00b050">Code Review</font>**. <u><em>Directly comment</em> on the GitHub Pull Request for any change suggestion and comments</u>.
	3. Create a **Bug Report** (a GitHub Issue) as needed.
3. Once implementation is **good** merge the GitHub Pull Request

Parallel[^2]with: [[4.2 Unit Testing]]
Next step: [[5 Mid-High Level Testing]]

[^1]: This allows the QA to write the test scripts in **parallel** as the Developer implements the solution plan.
[^2]: While developers implement the solution plan, QA  independently create and execute unit tests derived from the same solution plan. Results of these tests form a feedback loop, ensuring the implementation aligns with the intended solution.
