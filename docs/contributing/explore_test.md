## Assertions/Preconditions
<!-- 
 List any conditions that must be true before the exploratory test begins. 
 If there are none, write `NONE`.
 
 Examples
    Technical Requirements: 
        Java version, 
        PostgreSQL version, etc.

    Software Requirements: 
        Test database loaded, 
        User is logged in, 
        Tables are populated, etc.
 -->

## Scenario
<!-- 
 A NON-TECHNICAL and FREE-FORM description of the test steps. There should only
 be ONE scenario for an exploratory test report.

 Each step is formatted as:
    **Action #**. <description>
    **Expect 1**. <description>

 "Action" specifies the action to be performed by the tester.
 "Expect" specifies what the tester expects to happen after the action.

 Example Scenario:
    Action 1. I want to add a new member
    Action 2. I click the button that shows "Add Member"
    Action 3. I populate the information of the new Member.
    ...

 "Final Expectation" specifies the expected result of the scenario when all
 actions succeed.
 -->

**Action 1**. %Description%
**Expect 1**. %Description%

**Action 2**. %Description%
**Expect 2**. %Description%

**Action 3**. %Description%
**Expect 3**. %Description%

**Final Expectation**. %ExpectedResult%

## Observation
<!-- 
 A NON-TECHNICAL and FREE-FORM description of your observations throughout
 the exploratory test. This can include one of the following:
    UI quirks           (something moves around)
    Performance quirks  (it gets slow when I do ...)

 This SHOULD NOT INCLUDE bugs or issues. See the Issues section below.

 Format:
 | Doing | Event | Attachments |
 | ----- | ----- | ----------- |
 | %ActionNumber% | %Description% | %Attachments% |

 - Doing: a NON-TECHNICAL and FREE-FORM description of the action being 
 performed when the observed event occured. Provide a short description. 
 Example: "hovering on Add Member button"

 - Event: a NON-TECHNICAL and FREE-FORM description of the observed event.
 Example: "the button grew bigger"

 - Issue: the Issue number from GitHub (you SHOULD publish the Issue in the 
 GitHub repository)
 
 - Action: action being performed when the observed event occured. Indicate
 the action number.

 - Event: a NON-TECHNICAL and FREE-FORM description of the observed event
 or result after performing the action.
